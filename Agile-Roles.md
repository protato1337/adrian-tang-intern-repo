# *Research & Learn*

## *What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?*

### *Developers*

*Build features, fix bugs, write code, review code, and deliver working increments of the product. They collaborate closely with PM, QA, and designers to turn requirements into working software.*

### *QA (Quality Assurance)*

*Test features, verify quality, identify bugs, and ensure the product meets acceptance criteria. They help prevent defects and maintain product reliability.*

### *Product Manager (PM)*

*Defines product vision, prioritises work, gathers requirements, writes user stories, and ensures the team is building the right things. The PM connects customer needs with development priorities.*

### *Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)*

*Facilitates workflow, removes blockers, organises tasks, ensures smooth communication, and supports continuous improvement. They help the team stay productive and aligned.*

### *Other Supporting Roles (e.g., Stakeholders, UX, Customer Support)*

*Stakeholders provide business direction and feedback.*
*UX designers create wireframes, prototypes, and user flows.*
*Customer support shares insights from users, reports issues, and helps prioritise problems to address.*

## *How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?*

*In Scrum, collaboration happens within structured ceremonies: sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Roles interact heavily during each sprint cycle.*
*In Kanban, collaboration is continuous. Work flows across the board, and team members coordinate daily to pull tasks, address blockers, and adjust priorities. There are fewer formal ceremonies, but communication happens in real time.*

# *Reflection*

## *What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?*

*As a Cybersecurity Analyst at Focus Bear, my role contributes by identifying and mitigating security risks, reviewing features for vulnerabilities, helping implement secure practices, and ensuring that security is integrated into ongoing work. I support continuous delivery by keeping security aligned with fast-changing priorities in our Kanban workflow.*

## *How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles?*

*My work overlaps with developers during code reviews or when recommending security fixes. I interact with QA when validating secure behaviour. I coordinate with the PM to ensure security requirements are prioritised, and I work with the Agile PM to track security tasks. I may also collaborate with UX and stakeholders to ensure designs and data flows follow security best practices.*

# *Task*

## *Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.*

*As a Cybersecurity Analyst, I fit into the Agile team by ensuring security is embedded in every stage of work. I perform assessments, advise on secure design, identify vulnerabilities, and collaborate with developers, QA, and PMs to ensure the product remains safe while still moving quickly through the Kanban workflow.*

## *Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how to improve teamwork with them.*

*I frequently collaborate with developers. I can improve teamwork by giving clear, actionable security recommendations, sharing context behind risks, communicating early about vulnerabilities, and working with them to find solutions that balance security with practicality and delivery speed.*
