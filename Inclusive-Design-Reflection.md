## Research & Learn

### Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?
*People with affecting factors like age, socioeconomic status, digital literacy, or disability. So for example: elderly people, low-income individuals, ethnic minorities, and people with mental or cognitive impairments.*

*They face challenges like limited access to devices or reliable internet, difficulty navigating complex online systems, and increased exposure to risks like misinformation or cyberbullying.*

### What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)
*Recognize individuality, reduce sensory overload, and design for cognitive diversity. Make sure their privacy and confidentiality is protected and use clear communication.*

### How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)
*Provide information in multiple formats and avoid idioms or figures of speech that can be misinterpreted. Promote predicatability by using clear, direct and concise language, and provide information in advance.*

*Use clean, simple disgn. Clear fonts. Use captions and even audio descriptions.*

### How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)
*Be direct and clear. Clarify expectation. Be patient.*

*Offer flexibility and minimize sensory distractions. Manage changes carefully.*

## Reflection

### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
*Ask them for any communication preferences as some may prefer email or message over verbal communication, and try my best ability to communicate to them in the way they best respond to.*

*Communicate in literal, plain language, break down tasks into smaller steps where possible and let them know that they can ask to clarify questions.*

### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
*(Based on the desktop version)*

*1. Under "Preferences", the window of the app changes when user navigating different tabs/settings. So user resizing the window doesn't really work as it never stays.*

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
*Provide plan or schedule or update to my best of ability as research shows some ADHD people appreciate the predictability of a routine. But also provide flexibility with schedules as thnigs don't always go to plan.*

## Task

~~Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)~~

### Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.
*More language options*

*Tutorials can include a text format as an alternative. (like a QnA or even chatbot).*

~~Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.~~
