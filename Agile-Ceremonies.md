# Research & Learn

## What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?

### *Daily Stand-ups*

*Short daily meetings where team members share what they did, what they’re doing next, and any blockers. Helps maintain alignment and surface issues quickly.*

### *Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)*

*Sprint Planning defines work for the next sprint in Scrum. In Kanban, there are no sprints—priorities are updated continuously, allowing the team to pull the most important work at any time.*

### *Retrospectives*

*A ceremony where the team reflects on what went well, what didn’t, and what improvements can be made. The goal is continuous improvement.*

### *Backlog Refinement*

*Regularly reviewing and updating tasks to ensure they are clear, prioritised, and ready for development.*

## How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

*They use tools like Kanban boards, shared docs, messaging platforms, and recorded updates. Clear documentation, timely updates, and written communication allow work to continue even when teammates aren’t online at the same time.*

# Reflection

## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

*They ensure everyone is aware of progress, priorities, blockers, and goals. Regular touchpoints reduce miscommunication, keep tasks moving, and help different roles stay coordinated.*

## Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?

*For a Cybersecurity Analyst, daily stand-ups and backlog refinement are most important because they reveal new risks, security-related blockers, and upcoming tasks that need review. They help ensure security considerations stay visible in a fast-moving Kanban environment.*

# Task

## ~~Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.~~

## ~~Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.~~

## Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.

*I will provide clearer security impact notes on tasks so developers and PMs can make better prioritisation decisions.*
