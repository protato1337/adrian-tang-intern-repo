## Reflection

### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
*Best to use AI when you want a concept to be explained in an efficient way. Or you simply need to lookup a piece code when you forgot it. AI also comes in useful when dealing with data, identifying pattern in a dataset or generating a quick summary for a handful of sources.*

*But when it comes to design, or involve communicating with people, we should rely on our own skills.*

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
*Make sure you understand everything the AI generated, and always ask further questions to the original one, so that you are not blindly, passively receiving everything the AI given to you.*

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
*Double check everything you entered or copy and paste doesn't contain PII.* 

## Task

### Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
