# *Research & Learn*

## *How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?*

*A Kanban board visualises work by displaying tasks in columns that represent different stages of progress. It helps manage workflow by making priorities clear, showing bottlenecks, supporting continuous delivery, and allowing the team to focus on one stage of work at a time.*

## *What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?*

*Backlog: Tasks waiting to be picked up.*
*To Do / Ready: Tasks prioritised and ready to start.*
*In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.*
*Blocked: Tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues.*
*Review / QA: Tasks awaiting verification or testing.*
*Done: Tasks fully completed.*

## *How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?*

*Tasks move from left to right as work progresses. Each person is responsible for updating the status of the tasks they are working on, ensuring the board always reflects the current state of the workflow.*

## *What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?*

*Limiting WIP prevents overload, improves focus, reduces context switching, increases quality, reveals bottlenecks, and helps tasks get completed faster instead of being half-done.*

# *Reflection*

## *How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?*

*Kanban makes current work visible, ensures only a manageable number of tasks are active, highlights blocked tasks quickly, and allows the team to focus on finishing before starting new work. This prevents overwhelm and keeps priorities clear.*

## *How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?*

*By keeping tasks small, updating the board frequently, limiting WIP, breaking down unclear tasks, and reviewing the board daily to track progress and identify blockers early.*

# *Task*

## ~~Check out Focus Bear’s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured.~~

## ~~*Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.*~~

## *Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.*

*One improvement could be adding clearer security-related notes or context when updating task status, so developers and PMs can quickly understand risks, dependencies, or required action.*
