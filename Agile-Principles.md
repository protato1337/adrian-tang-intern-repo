# *Research & Learn*

## *What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?*

*Agile is an iterative, flexible approach to project management that focuses on continuous improvement, collaboration, and responding to change. Traditional (Waterfall) project management is linear, highly structured, and requires detailed planning upfront. Agile adapts as the project progresses, while Waterfall follows a fixed sequence of phases.*

## *What are the core values and principles of Agile?*

*Agile values **individuals** and **interactions** over processes and tools, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. Its principles include **frequent delivery**, **continuous improvement**, collaboration, simplicity, sustainable pace, and adapting based on feedback.*

## *What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?*

*Scrum uses fixed-length sprints, defined roles, ceremonies, and structured planning cycles. Kanban is continuous, flexible, and focuses on visualising workflow and limiting work in progress. Scrum is useful when work benefits from iteration and planning cycles; Kanban is ideal for continuous flow environments with changing priorities.*

## *Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?*

*Focus Bear’s work involves fast-changing priorities, continuous tasks, and frequent incoming requests, making Kanban’s flexible, flow-based system a better fit than fixed sprint cycles.*

# *Reflection*

## *What are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?*

*Benefits include adaptability, faster delivery, improved collaboration, and better handling of change. Challenges include unclear requirements, dependency on communication, and difficulty for teams used to strict structure.*

## *How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?*

*Agile encourages prioritisation, constant communication, quick feedback loops, and continuous learning—all of which can help you stay organised, deliver faster, and adapt more effectively.*

# *Task*

## *Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.*

*Scrum is structured with sprints, roles, and ceremonies, while Kanban is continuous, flexible, and focuses on managing flow and limiting work in progress.*

## *Identify one Agile principle that will be most useful in your work.*

*“Responding to change over following a plan” will help you stay flexible, adapt quickly, and adjust your work based on feedback or shifting priorities.*
